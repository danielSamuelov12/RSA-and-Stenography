Audio steganography is a technique for hiding information inside audio files in a way that the hidden data is not apparent to the human ear. This is achieved by making small changes to the audio file so that the changes do not affect the perceived sound quality. The most common approach involves altering the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of the audio samples.

Steganography Algorithm Process
Converting the Message to Binary:

First, the message we want to hide (such as text or data) is converted to binary format.
For example, the text "Hello" is converted to binary:
rust
Copy
Edit
H -> 01001000
e -> 01100101
l -> 01101100
l -> 01101100
o -> 01101111
The resulting binary data is:
Copy
Edit
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
Reading the Audio File:

The audio file (e.g., WAV or MP3) is opened, and it is converted into audio samples, which are binary numbers representing the audio's physical values.
Hiding the Information in the Audio File:

The algorithm hides the binary message inside the audio samples by altering the Least Significant Bits (LSBs). Each audio sample is a binary number, and each number has several bits. The LSBs are the bits that have the least impact on the sound, so they can be changed without noticeable effect on the audio.
For example, if an audio sample is 10101010, and its LSB is 0, it can be changed to 1, making the sample 10101011 without significantly affecting the sound.
The binary message is then embedded into the audio samples, with each bit of the message replacing the LSB of the corresponding audio sample.
Saving the New Audio File:

After the message has been hidden in the audio file, the modified audio is saved as a new audio file with the hidden message.
Practical Example
Let's assume we have the text "Hello" and we want to hide it inside an audio file audio.wav.

Converting the Text to Binary:

rust
Copy
Edit
H -> 01001000
e -> 01100101
l -> 01101100
l -> 01101100
o -> 01101111
Reading the Audio File: Suppose the audio file audio.wav contains audio samples like:

Copy
Edit
10101010
11001100
10110101
11110000
Hiding the Message: We take the binary message "Hello" and begin embedding it into the audio samples, replacing the LSB of each sample with each bit of the message:

The first sample is 10101010, and its LSB is 0. We replace it with the first bit of the message, which is 0, so the sample remains 10101010.
The second sample is 11001100, and its LSB is 0. We replace it with the second bit of the message, which is 1, so the sample changes to 11001101.
This process continues until all the binary message is embedded into the audio samples.
